### Collapse

```
<details>
  <summary markdown="span">This is the summary text, click me to expand</summary>

  This is the detailed text.

  We can still use markdown, but we need to take the additional step of using the `parse_block_html` option as described in the [Mix HTML + Markdown Markup section](#mix-html--markdown-markup).

  You can learn more about expected usage of this approach in the [GitLab UI docs](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-collapse--default) though the solution we use above is specific to usage in markdown.
